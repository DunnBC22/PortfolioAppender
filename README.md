# PortfolioAppender

When applying for jobs on LinkedIn, you can only upload your resume. So, I append some assessments to the end of the resume to demonstrate my skillset. Instead of manually appending the assessments to each resume, this script automates that. I make sure to make adjustments (additions and subtractions as necessary, but this saves time. Also, it saves space on my hard drive relative to how I use to append my portfolio to my resume!
